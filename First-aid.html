        <h1>How to use first aid</h1>
        <p>To use first-aid, first assess for danger and call for professional help.   Next, check the person's airway and
            breathing, and if they are not breathing normally, begin CPR immediately. For bleeding, apply direct
            pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or sterile dressing, and if possible, elevate the area to slow
            blood flow. Before starting first-aid
            Ensure safety: Before you approach the person, check for any dangers that could harm you or them.
            Call for help: Call emergency services immediately for serious injuries.
            Protect yourself: Wear disposable gloves to protect yourself from bloodborne pathogens. Do not breathe or
            cough over the wound.
            For a person who is not breathing normally
            Start CPR:
            Give 30 chest compressions by placing the heel of one hand on the center of the chest and pressing down
            about 5-6 cm at a rate of 100-120 per minute.
            Give 2 rescue breaths by tilting the head back, lifting the chin, pinching the nose, and blowing steadily
            into the mouth until the chest rises.
            Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until help arrives or the person starts to breathe.
            Use an AED: If an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is available, use it immediately and follow its
            voice prompts.
            For cuts and bleeding
            Apply pressure: Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or sterile dressing to stop bleeding.
            Clean the wound: Gently rinse the wound with water. Avoid using soap on an open wound.
            Cover the wound: Cover the wound with a sterile dressing or clean cloth.
            Elevate the injury: If possible, raise the injured part of the body above heart level to help reduce
            bleeding.
            For other injuries
            Sprains: Rest the injured part, apply an ice pack for 20 minutes, and elevate it to help reduce swelling.
            Fractures: Keep the injured area as still as possible and use a splint if you are trained to do so. Do not
            try to realign a dislocated bone.
            Burns: Seek immediate medical attention for serious burns.
            General care: Do not give the person anything to eat or drink. Keep them warm with a coat or blanket and
            offer reassurance. </p>
