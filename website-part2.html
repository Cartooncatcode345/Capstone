        <h2>Pizza and its history</h2>
        <p>

            Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based
            dough topped with ingredients such as tomato sauce, cheese (typically mozzarella), and various other
            toppings, which is then baked at a high temperature. It is one of the most popular foods in the world.

            The history of pizza begins with various ancient cultures producing flatbreads with toppings. The modern
            pizza, however, evolved in Naples, Italy, where the poor working class would top their flatbreads with
            tomatoes and other simple ingredients.
            The iconic Pizza Margherita is attributed to Neapolitan baker Raffaele Esposito, who, in 1889, created a
            pizza for Queen Margherita of Savoy featuring the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), white
            (mozzarella), and green (basil).
            Italian immigrants brought pizza to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where it
            gained immense popularity and evolved into distinct regional styles.

            Barbecue pizza typically refers to a pizza that uses a barbecue sauce base instead of traditional tomato sauce, and is topped with ingredients such as BBQ chicken, red onions, and cheese. It is a popular, flavorful dish that can be made at home or ordered from various restaurants, including local options in the Mirpur, Dhaka area.
