        <h1>Earthquakes</h1>
        <h3>What are earthqakes</h3>
        <p>Earthquakes are the sudden, violent shaking of the ground, caused by the movement of tectonic plates. As these plates move, friction builds up stress until the rocks along a fault suddenly break and slip, releasing energy as seismic waves that cause the ground to shake. Most earthquakes are small and imperceptible, but some are powerful enough to cause significant damage. </p>

        <h3>What to do when a earthquake hits</h3>
        <p>The best way to survive a earthquake is to be calm and use all senses of your  mind.what u have to do is immediately Drop, Cover, and Hold On.Drop, Cover, and Hold On: Drop to your hands and knees. Crawl under a sturdy table or desk and hold on to it with one hand while covering your head and neck with your other arm.
        No sturdy furniture: If no table or desk is nearby, move to an interior wall or corner and cover your head and neck with your arms.
        Stay put: Do not run outside or to other rooms during the shaking, as falling debris is dangerous. Stay away from windows, mirrors, and anything that could fall on you.
        In bed: Stay in bed and cover your head and neck with a pillow. </p>
